    <h3>A Bit About Me 💻</h3>
    <p>Hiya, my name is Nobu and I am a weeb that resides in Romania.</p>
    <p>At a young age I found a passion in deconstructing problems into smaller parts and creating a solution hence I found my passion in using different technologies to solve problems.</p>
    <p><i><strike>And make completely useless shit for fun</strike></i></p>

    <p align="left">I primarily work with these techonologies:</p>

    <br /><br /><br />
    <p align="left">However, I am knowledgable in a handful more technologies, I just dont utilize them as often these days as they wield no use to my interests.</p>
